1.	Introduction
1.1	Purpose 
This application is to update and alert road drivers on on respective routes on the most current status of the traffic. The application will be able to recognise the traffic using the camera once it is pointed directed towards the traffic and update the application instantly. The application will be able to capture both photo graphs and also videos and now it will be upon the road users to ie drivers to decide. For this same application, improvements will be made so that a the application is able to judge and make a descission.
1.2	Document Conventions
<Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.>
1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for the project manager for assessment and fellow developers for improvement. 
<Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.>
1.4	Product Scope
This appliccation is intended to limit traffic jam on many roads in different subburbs. This is to minimise the travel time of many road users especially drivers and and riders. The WAZE-GPS, Maps Traffic alerts & live Navigation is a similar application but does not provide 

<Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.>
1.5	References
<List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.>
2.	Overall Description
2.1	Product Perspective

This product is a new selfconned product 
<Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.>
2.2	Product Functions


This product is to help the user to know where traffic jam is and avoid it.
This product is to minimize the travel time of the drivers to their destinations
Through the use of this app, the government can analyze the roads which have a lot of traffic always and work on it.
Programming well
2.3	User Classes and Characteristics
Operational class
This application is mainly for the road users especially the driver of vehicles of all kinds forexample trucks, salon, buses and vans especially taxis. This application is mainly developed because of the many alternative short cuts that drivers may many want to use but limited because of the ignorance of the road status.
The operational class will be used to always update the application for use of all the application users, this is the most important class of all because it updates the roads and enable the application to perform to its expectation. In this class, the driver driver at certain point opens the app, and he thought the internet updates the application on how the traffic is moving while others also do the same.

Updating class:
This will be left to the developers that will improve the application functionalities and also its work-ability, adding application functions etc, in the ranking this class is the second.

Marketing class 
This application will be sold to the users by this class, so for it to be used by the drivers, to be used by companies to market their products and services,m the marketing team will also do a great job to sell the app. 
2.4	Operating Environment
This application will operate in city suburbs where congestion is too much and traffic jam is the order of the day especially on the main roads.
The application is to be developed In android operating systemfor the beginning and will be improved to windows and other operation system. And this application is to be operated on mobile phones and tablets.
2.5	Design and Implementation Constraints
Timing 
The development of this application is so much affected by the limited time given to the developers. And because of this the developers have been in a rash in every thing in the development of this application.

Memory requirement.
This application requires strong machines with very fast processors because the development software used to develop the application are very heavy in-terms of memory consumption. This slowed down the development and made the processes boring.



interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>
2.6	User Documentation

<List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.>
2.7	Assumptions and Dependencies
<List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).>
3.	External Interface Requirements
3.1	User Interfaces
<Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.>
3.2	Hardware Interfaces
<Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.>
3.3	Software Interfaces
<Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.>
3.4	Communications Interfaces
<Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.>
